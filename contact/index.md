Our group is based at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) and [BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHR)](https://bcchr.ca). Dr. Korthauer splits her time between her office in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.ubc.ca) on UBC's main campus (Earth Sciences Building 3108) and her office at BCCHR, where our lab space is located (on the third floor of the [Variety Building](https://www.bcchr.ca/weber-lab/contact)).

We respectfully recognize that our workplace is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish peoples: xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. We are privileged to occupy this territory as univited guests, and invite you to learn more about the indigenous peoples from this land by visiting [this interactive indigenous land map](https://native-land.ca/).
